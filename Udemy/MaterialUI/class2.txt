Why MATERIAL UI?
Implement High Fidelity Designs with Material-UI & React JS

PROBLEM
React, Redux, understand components, state, props and JSX. And you want to
understand how they fit together?

- Creating consistent components.
- Don't reinvent the wheel.

SOLUTION

- Standardized components and funcionality.
Options:
-Option1: Bootstrap/React-Bootstrap.
    - Oldest.
    - Not originally for React.
    - Somewhat restrictive.
-Option2: Semantic-UI/Semantic-UI-React
    - Also ported.
    - Not React-specific styling.
    - Dependent on main library.
-Option3: MATERIAL-UI
    - Explicitly built for React.
    - Extreme flexibility.
    - Maintains consistency.
    - Active development.
    - Advanced feature support.
